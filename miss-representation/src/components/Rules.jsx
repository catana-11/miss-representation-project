            <h2>Rules for using the Miss Representation Project:</h2> <br></br>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Respect the Purpose:</strong> This project aims to address gender representation issues through AI. Please use it in a manner consistent with promoting gender equality and empowering underrepresented groups.</li> <br></br>
                <li><strong>No Misguidance/misuse:</strong> Do not use misguiding prompts to divert the use of Gemini AI or misuse the prompts to justify wrong actions.</li> <br></br>
                <li><strong>Appropriate Content Submission:</strong> When using the platform, make sure you submit only YouTube links / article texts that you have copied.</li> <br></br>
                <li><strong>Google Form submissions:</strong> Do be respectful and proper in language, if you wish to submit a Google Form review. Only morally valid responses will be tolerated.</li> <br></br>
                <li><strong>AI-generated Results:</strong> The summaries provided by the AI are based on the content input by users. While the AI analyzes text with accuracy, it is recommended that users validate the results independently.</li> <br></br>
                <li><strong>Privacy and Data Protection:</strong> Be mindful of privacy concerns when submitting text or URLs. Do not submit personal, sensitive, or confidential information.</li> <br></br>
                <li><strong>No Malicious Usage:</strong> The platform should not be used for spamming, data scraping, or attempting to compromise the functionality of the system in any way.</li> <br></br>
                <li><strong>Encouraging Positive Change:</strong> This project is about empowering voices and encouraging awareness of gender-related issues. We encourage constructive feedback and the sharing of ideas that contribute positively to the movement.</li> <br></br>
                <li><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The AI tool is intended to raise awareness and provide insights but may not be perfect. Please understand that results are automated and not always flawless.</li> <br></br>
                <li><strong>Credits:</strong> Do not claim this project to be of your own making on any other platform. If you wish to mention it, do credit appropriately.</li> <br></br>
