Miss Representation

Combating Online Bias Against Women

Miss Representation tackles the issue of online negativity towards women by analyzing comments, views, articles, interviews, videos, and tweets. This project empowers positive representation of women in the digital landscape.

Developed During Google Hackathon

This project was created during the Google Hackathon, showcasing its potential for rapid development and impact.

Scalability and Integration

Miss Representation boasts high scalability, allowing for integration with various platforms like Twitter bots, Discord bots, and potentially others you may identify in the future. While a Twitter bot was prototyped during the hackathon, time constraints prevented its full completion.
